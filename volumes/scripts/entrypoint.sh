# This script serves as the entrypoint for the Snort container.
#
# Functionality:
# - Logs the startup of the Snort container.
# - Inserts NFQUEUE iptables rules on start.
# - Removes them on exit.
# - Executes /home/snorty/scripts/run_snort_notify.sh if present.
# - Optionally waits for Docker to mount volumes (adjustable or removable).
# - Checks for the existence and executability of a custom script located at
#   /home/snorty/scripts/run_snort.sh.
# - Executes the custom script if found and executable.
# - Logs a warning if the custom script is not found or is not executable.
# - Optionally keeps the container running or starts a real process (commented out by default).
#
# Usage:
# - Place this script in the container's designated entrypoint path.
# - Ensure the custom script (/home/snorty/scripts/run_snort.sh) exists and has executable permissions.
#
# Notes:
# - Modify the sleep duration or remove the sleep command if volume mounting delay is not an issue.
# - Uncomment and replace the `exec` command at the end to start a real process if needed.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e
